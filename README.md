Series of Apps to help targeted people

After reading this Article, http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/delta-air-lines-adam-saleh.html about being kicked out of a plane for speaking arabic, I decided to write a social app so targetted people can work together when being singled out.

The name is based on the 1942 Jack Spatt Coffee Shop Siting: http://interactive.wttw.com/timemachine/jack-spratt-coffee-shop-sit

The goal of the app is to launch a silent beacon to those around the person being targetted so other people can react with the correct information.

The goal is to create order around a volatile situation by organizing a counter protest and shame the bully.     

The app will open a screen were the person being targeted can quickly write his story and upload it to a server.   
The next step would be to turn on Bleutooth and broadcast a iBeacon so people can judge the distance to the person being targetted.    
The app will also need to broadcast an SSID to let know others that something is happening. Those with the app would then receive an alter prompting them to turn iBeacon.     

The app would then send a Facebook/Twitter notification with GPS coordinate and then turn on video mode.   

The appp for the user being targetted need to be 2 clicks:   
-1 Type as quickly as possible the storyline of the target  
-2 Start recording and posting as well .....   

For the people arround:   
-1 Receive the beacon, propose various scenarios   
-2 Invite the user to participate (click to say : "I am with you.")    
-3 Offer the choice to retweet and repost on facebook   
-4 Start recording and posting as well (if possible) .....
