Series of Apps to help targeted people

After reading this Article, http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/delta-air-lines-adam-saleh.html about being kicked out of a plane for speaking arabic, I decided to write a social app so targetted people can work together when being singled out.

The name is based on the 1942 Jack Spatt Coffee Shop Siting: http://interactive.wttw.com/timemachine/jack-spratt-coffee-shop-sit

The goal of the app is to launch a silent beacon to those around the person being targetted so other people can react with the correct information.   

The approach is by using the rules of the Corporations about dealing with problematics issues.   

The format is pretty clear.    
1. Racist customer complains quietly to customer service as being uneasy     
2. Customer service approach the person causing the racist person to be uneasy (victim)     
3. Victim is surprised by the approach of customer service and the ridicouliness of the request      
4. Customer Service find itself at the receiving end by the victim     
5. Victim and Customer Service start fighting ....    
6. People around are oblivious of the scuffle taking place.   
7. Customer Service rep is not the judge and the jury.
7. Authories have been called and Victim is not very upset by lack of respect .    
8. Peope around have no recourse than silently vitness the issue.

The goal is to create order around a volatile situation by organizing a peacefull counter protest and shame the bully.     

The hope of the application is to bring local witnesses into the story as soon as point #3 takes place. By bringing the community around the issue, Customer Service will have to consider the bigger picture and ofter a different narative, like kicking the Racist Customer off the plane.

This issue play everytwhere, in planes, in supermarket checkout lines, etc ....

The app will open a screen were the person being targeted can quickly write his story and upload it to a server.   
The next step would be to turn on Bleutooth and broadcast a iBeacon so people can judge the distance to the person being targetted.       
The app will also need to broadcast an SSID to let know others that something is happening. Those with the app would then receive an alter prompting them to turn iBeacon.     

The app would then send a Facebook/Twitter notification with GPS coordinate and then turn on video mode.   

The appp for the user being targetted need to be 2 clicks:     
-1 Type as quickly as possible the storyline of the target  
-2 Start recording and posting as well .....   

For the people arround:   
-1 Receive the beacon, propose various scenarios   
-2 Invite the user to participate (click to say : "I am with you.")    
-3 Offer the choice to retweet and repost on facebook   
-4 Start recording and posting as well (if possible) .....
